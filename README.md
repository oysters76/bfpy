# Simple BrainF*ck Parser

BrainF*ck a programming language, know for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainf*ck requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.
